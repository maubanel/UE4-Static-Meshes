# UE4-Intro-To-Static-Meshes

<!-- OVERVIEW -->
## Overview
* Lets look at **[static meshes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_mesh)**.

 This walk through adds a bit more detail to the excellent Unreal Tutorial segments [Building Better Pipelines](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/onlinelearning-courses/building-better-pipelines).  The two chapters we are touching on the most are: **Static Meshes** and **Exporting & Importing**. We will be using **Maya** instead of **3D Studio Max** as our 3-D editor for this section.

 The most common part of a level are static meshes.  There are two types of meshes in games: Static Meshes and Skeletal Meshes.  A skeletal mesh includes a bone system used for animation.  A static mesh system has no internal animation but can be moved by the physics system of the engine.

 There is a lot to identifying a good static mesh and solve some of the problems associated with them.  Lets take a look.
  

* Tested on UE4 4.26
* Required to install: Github, GitHub Desktop, Git, Git LFS, Maya, and Unreal Engine
